## Overview

Chess is an age-old game that traces back all the way to the 7th century. It has evolved over time with countless players studying the game and pushing the needle forward. The game started to advance more rapidly when chess engines were introduced in the 1950's. As engines improved, people improved by leveraging the knowledge of these engines to improve their own game. The culmination of all this progress brings us to today, where anyone can go online and play chess against other people and immediately review their mistakes and successes from a game right after it concludes.

This project is an exploration of current chess trends and what is changing over time. It analyzes games spanning the last 5 years from a random subset of users playing at all levels from casual to professional. I perform exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing to search for answers to the following questions:

1. How does the way people play chess differ across different skill levels?

2. What is the skill distribution across all chess players?

3. Is the game still changing?

The answers to these questions serve to provide a concise overview that can inform someone about the current state of chess at a cursory glance.
